# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Using Colorado Board of Election data for the 2017 local congressional election, we are determining the total votes for each county and candidate. Data was provided from the University of Wisconsin.

In this project's scenario, we are tasked by a Colorado Board of Elections employee and they have given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of counties where votes were cast.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each county recieved. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each county.
5. Determine the county that recieved the most votes. 
6. Get a complete list of candiddates who received votes.
7. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
8. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
9. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary
We could do more with this code if we were to add to it. Suppose the Colorado Board of Elections, or political party, wanted to add extra districts, candidate political affiliation, or more demographics - we can apply that to our code. This will return a more robust analysis for future election results and will allow campaigns to strategize more efficiently for the next election cycle.
